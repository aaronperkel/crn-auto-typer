# crn-auto-typer
This Python script automates the entry of Course Registration Numbers (CRNs) into a university registration form using the pyautogui library. After a brief countdown, it types each CRN into the form, navigates between input fields using the ‘Tab’ key, and submits the form by pressing ‘Enter’, streamlining the course registration process.
